# Accident-prevention-and-Alert-System

This Arduino-based system is designed for accident prevention and emergency response. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects in front of the vehicle, and if an object comes within a certain distance, the vehicle automatically slows down. In the event of an accident, the system sends an emergency message to the nearest police station, hospital, and your emergency contacts.
